# Sorting Visualizer
Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I build this application because I was fascinated by sorintg algorithms. Therefore, I wanted to make them visualize and observe them. You can access it here(use Google Chrome!) https://armanengin.github.io/.

## Project Description
* This is a project visualizes the 5 important sorting algorithms(selection, insertion, bubble, merge, quick).
* For every sorting algorithms the red color reflects how this algorithms work.

### To Do
* If one push the 2 soritng algorithm buttons consecutively, algorithms work together. Which can be prevented by pushing new array button after pushing one of the sorting algorithms button.
